# Pictures and Diagrams
The pictures are of the fully 3D printed prototype, as I neglected to take any of the completed gearbox (this was a lesson learned).  
The videos are of the completed gearbox with aluminium shafts and acrylic gears.

Diagrams.pptx was used to create various diagrams for the group report.
I built a basic model of the gearbox in Fusion360 (I'm more familar, and it is easier to build a simple assembly), and exported the drawings to crop and paste into Powerpoint. 
The SFD, BMD and TD plots were made with MATLAB since I'm more familiar with creating complicated plots using it.
