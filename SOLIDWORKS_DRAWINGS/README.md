# SOLIDWORKS DRAWINGS
These are the technical drawings from SolidWorks for the gearbox. I did all of the modelling, and some of the drawings that were submitted in the report (I included my own versions here for the sake of completion).

The drawings were broken down into letter coded sections. This made it easier to delegate subassembelies and combine the individual drawings into one for the group report.

### A: Top Level Assembly
### B: Front Housing
### C: Middle Housing & Housing Alignment Rod
### D: Rear Housing
### E: Stage 1 Carrier
### F: Stage 2 Carrier
### G: Stand
### H: Other Parts, used in assembly
